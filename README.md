# PRODIGY_ML_05

I have developed a deep learning model based on Task-05: "Develop a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices." This model is capable of identifying various food items from images and estimating their calorie content. It aims to assist users in tracking their diet and making healthier food choices.

### Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the *Food-101* dataset from Kaggle, which contains images of 101 different food categories. These images were used to train and evaluate the model. You can access the dataset here: [Food-101](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101). Download the dataset and use it for the code.

### Steps to Use the Dataset:
1. Download the *Food-101* dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
2. Upload the dataset to your Google Drive in a folder named "Datasets" for easier access.
3. Open Google Colab.
4. Add a code cell above your existing code in the provided `.ipynb` file to mount your Google Drive.
5. Run the code cells in the notebook after mounting the drive to access the dataset and execute the code.

### Code Execution:
The code is inside the `Food-Item-Recognition.ipynb` file. After mounting your Google Drive, run the cells in the notebook to execute the code.

### Knowledge Gained:
1. **Technical Mastery**: This project greatly enhanced my technical skills, particularly in using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. I also gained valuable experience in transfer learning using pre-trained models like MobileNetV2, which allowed me to leverage existing knowledge and adapt it to new tasks. Additionally, I worked with data augmentation techniques such as rescaling, flipping, and zooming, which helped improve the model’s robustness and adaptability to varied inputs.

2. **Practical Insights**: Throughout this project, I encountered several practical challenges, particularly in training the model with a diverse range of food items. I learned how crucial it is to have a balanced dataset to achieve accurate results. Variability in the data can significantly impact model performance, so careful attention to data augmentation and preprocessing steps was essential in ensuring the model’s ability to generalize well.

3. **Optimization Techniques**: As I trained the model, I refined my skills in hyperparameter tuning and learned the importance of using callbacks such as early stopping and model checkpoints. These techniques helped optimize the model’s performance and prevent overfitting. Fine-tuning learning rates, batch sizes, and other parameters greatly contributed to improving the model's efficiency and accuracy.

4. **Real-World Application**: Developing this model provided me with hands-on experience in creating a practical application that combines machine learning with real-world dietary tracking. I gained a deeper appreciation for the potential of AI in health and wellness. This project demonstrated how technology can provide actionable insights, such as estimating calorie content, to help users make informed decisions about their diet. It not only strengthened my technical skills but also fueled my interest in applying AI to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives.
